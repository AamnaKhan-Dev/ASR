## üß† ADHD-Specific Features

### 1. Energy Level Matching
- Users set their current energy level (1-5)
- Tasks are filtered based on energy requirements
- High-energy tasks suggested during peak hours (9-11 AM)
- Low-energy tasks during afternoon dips

### 2. Dopamine-Driven Prioritization
```dart
// Example scoring factors:
- Urgency: 25% weight
- Importance: 20% weight
- Energy Match: 15% weight
- Dopamine Potential: 15% weight
- Time Optimization: 10% weight
- Interest Level: 10% weight
- Context Suitability: 5% weight
```

### 3. Attention Span Optimization
- Quick tasks (‚â§15 min) promoted during low-focus periods
- Hyperfocus tasks (‚â•30 min) suggested during peak energy
- Automatic break reminders for long sessions
- Flexible time estimates based on task complexity

### 4. Motivational Systems
- Celebration messages for completed tasks
- Progress tracking with streak counters
- Milestone achievements (every 5 tasks)
- Positive reinforcement throughout the day

## üé§ Voice Commands

### Task Creation
- "Create a task to call mom"
- "Remind me to take medication today"
- "I need to finish the report by Friday"
- "Add a high-priority task to review documents"

### Task Management
- "Complete grocery shopping"
- "Mark workout as done"
- "List my tasks for today"
- "What should I work on now?"

### Information Queries
- "Show me my quick tasks"
- "What's on my schedule?"
- "How many tasks did I complete today?"
- "Help me understand how this works"

## üé® ADHD-Friendly UI Design

### Color Psychology
- **Blue**: Calming, focus-enhancing (primary actions)
- **Green**: Achievement, progress (completed tasks)
- **Orange**: Attention, urgency (high-priority items)
- **Purple**: Creativity, motivation (creative tasks)
- **Gold**: Celebration, achievement (milestones)

### Typography
- **Clear Sans-Serif**: Improved readability
- **Generous Line Spacing**: Reduced visual clutter
- **Consistent Sizing**: Predictable information hierarchy
- **High Contrast**: Better focus and attention

### Animation Patterns
- **Smooth Transitions**: Reduced cognitive load
- **Celebration Animations**: Dopamine reinforcement
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear feedback loops
- **Gentle Fades**: Non-jarring state changes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Speech Recognition
```dart
// ADHD-optimized settings
Duration listenTimeout = Duration(seconds: 30);  // Longer patience
Duration pauseTimeout = Duration(seconds: 3);    // Quick response
bool partialResults = true;                      // Real-time feedback
```

### Intent Recognition Pipeline
1. **Local Pattern Matching** (fast, offline)
   - Common phrases and commands
   - Task action detection
   - Category and urgency extraction

2. **LLM Processing** (fallback for complex commands)
   - GPT-4 with ADHD-specific prompts
   - Confidence scoring
   - Structured JSON output

### Task Prioritization Algorithm
```dart
double calculatePriorityScore(Task task) {
  final urgencyScore = _calculateUrgencyScore(task);
  final energyScore = _calculateEnergyScore(task);
  final dopamineScore = task.dopamineScore * 100.0;
  final timeScore = _calculateTimeOptimization(task);
  
  return (urgencyScore * 0.25) +
         (energyScore * 0.15) +
         (dopamineScore * 0.15) +
         (timeScore * 0.10) +
         /* ... other factors */;
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tasks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  due_date INTEGER,
  completed_at INTEGER,
  estimated_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
  energy_level INTEGER NOT NULL,        -- 1-5 scale
  dopamine_score REAL NOT NULL,         -- 0-1 scale
